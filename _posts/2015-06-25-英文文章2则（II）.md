> **第二篇文章，是看To kill a mockingbird的演讲---courage**

                                     About Courage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have nothing to fear, the only thing worth to be afraid is afraid of itself.last week , we saw To kill a mockingbird , the father, Atticus, has served as a moral hero , he shows a great courage in front of us , even face the threaten which may harm his kids and wife , but he still insist to take the case.
Courage is a strength that you can refresh even after a great defeat. Courage is a power that though getting hurt, but you still stand up to run. Courage is a spirit you face everything even thought knowing it’s hard to overcome.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courage isn’t an impulse, motivating us to achieve things others dares not to do. That may lead you to be a criminal, a thief, or a person who be addicted to drugs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This remain me another movie , The Shawshank Redemption , It’s my favorite movie , not one of my favorite . the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. Andy shows his great courage , whatever is to fight with "the Sisters" or the warden . But at the begining Andy is regularly assaulted by the "the Sisters" and their leader, Bogs. But Andy helped Bogs once and Bogs take “the Sisters” down. At the end of the story ,Andy return the warden that Bible and successfully escaped, I know Andy is not a Institutionalization person , he has his thought and courage , some birds aren't meant to be caged their feathers are just too bright.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here comes my story, after Ms.Dossett told us, Amanda and I should give a 90 minutes class to all of you next week, the inner voice of my heart went like this "how can I do this? I'v never done this before......" I really crashed, but I thought if I didn't overcome this difficulty this time, I would be under the shadow of Stage Fright. So I made plans and practiced with Amanda over and over again, and of course, we made it, even it didn't perfectly good, but we still overcome it, using our courage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person can’t do without courage in terms of love and friendship ,let alone life . A weak person may avoid the difficulties ,but a person with courage will face up to it head-on. Therefore,let’equip ourselves with great courage.


> **附：结课演讲（注，因为是最后一个发言，所以有机会做这个演讲）**
 > **I know the time would be so tight that I can't make my whole speech, it's really a long speech I'v prepared... But I want to make three thanks, even we have not enough time, I have to make them. The first thank is for Ms. Dossett, she is the best English teacher I'v ever met, she encouraged us to do a lot of projects, some of them can be called sort of "Mission Impossible", under her encouragement We'v done them eventually; The second person I want to thank is our beauty --- Amanda, she is so gogerous, because of my easily extracted concentration, I can't interpret very well, especially after a long and fast speed speech given by Ms. Dosstt T^T, but Amanda can do them well; The third thank is for all of you, whatever went out to have brunch or went to the zoo, we really share a great time together, if there is any chances I want to share the same class with you, all of you! Thank you!**
