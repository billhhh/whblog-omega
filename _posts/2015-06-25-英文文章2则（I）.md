> **评论模块已经up，可以评论咯**

> **背景：昨天没有发博文，今天补发一下，英语口语课结束了，挺舍不得Ms.Dossett，她自己本人也是一个容易动情的人，在她的课堂上，我们每节课都要求做一个project，whatever是一个段视频还是一个演讲，虽然是正式enroll的student，但是误打误撞被特别任命为班级的TA，负责组织过出游吃西餐，全班去动物园玩，讲过90分钟课【T^T】，但是很难忘，很难忘，昨天最后一次作业交了---是一篇期末总结，舒了一口气，但是这也意味着口语课的结束，意味着不能跟Ms.Dossett和那帮可爱的同学一起上课了。这两篇essay是我原创，一篇就是这个期末总结，另一篇是之前看To kill a mockingbird的演讲---courage。另外评论系统还没有完全做好，到时候会开放评论**

                                --- This essay is for Ms. Dossett, written by Bill
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I want to quote a movie to start my essay --- The Shawshank Redemption , my favorite movie , not one of.It says some birds aren't meant to be caged, because their feathers are just too bright. But in Ms. Dossett’s class, every bird’s feather is bright, everyone can show ourself and learn a lot from here, not only English skills, but also leading skills, how to gain our speaking power and build our confidence, amazing!

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I always think myself as a out-of-box thinker, just like my blog goes. Maybe I would escape my own classes, so that I can attend other majors’ classes when I was still undergraduate student, and this frequently happened, just because I like so-called easy-teaching style, this is what I can really feel in Ms.Dossett’s class, she is not only my teacher, but also my very good friend, we could talk about many interesting but meaningful topics in the class, at mean time, it had broaden our visual, I’m so glad to have a such good teacher. This course last for 16 weeks, during these 16 weeks, we done our Happyness project, we became directors and have a short video, we went out to have brunch and went to the zoo together, we gave Courage speech on the stage.....Everything was just like happened yesterday, I really want to share these things again with Ms. Dossett, with our dear classmates, I would miss you all.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If someone asks me, what’s the definition of a good teacher, I would tell him, using his or her own real feelings to teach, he or she is a good teacher. Ms. Dossett is using her real feeling to teach, I would never forget Ms. Dossett’s was been touched in the restaurant, and the last class. She is the best English teacher I’v ever met, we will all miss you~~Ms. Dossett.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;About this essay, it’s going to end, but I think it will never stop, there are so many words I want to say, but I can’t make it through papers.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me end up with a poem, it’s still not the time to say goodbye, but I have to fly away tonight, I'll miss you~~
